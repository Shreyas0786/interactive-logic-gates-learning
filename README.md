# Interactive Logic Gates Learning App

An educational web application designed to help students learn digital logic gates through interactive simulations and practice exercises.

## Features

### Interactive Gate Simulator
- Real-time input/output simulation for all basic logic gates
- Visual gate symbols with proper IEEE standards
- Dynamic truth tables that highlight current input combinations
- Instant feedback on gate behavior

### Supported Logic Gates
- **AND** - Output high when all inputs are high
- **OR** - Output high when any input is high  
- **NOT** - Inverts the input signal
- **NAND** - Negated AND operation
- **NOR** - Negated OR operation
- **XOR** - Output high when inputs differ
- **XNOR** - Output high when inputs are identical

### Practice Modules
- **Truth Table Quiz** - Identify gates based on their truth tables
- **Circuit Analysis** - Solve logic circuit problems with multiple gates
- Progress tracking and immediate feedback

## Technologies Used
- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (Vanilla)
- SVG graphics for gate symbols
- Responsive design for all devices
